    <div class="container"><h1 class="page-heading">Apartment Composting with Worms</h1><p>I live in an apartment which makes it harder to do your composting. However with vermicomposting, it can still be done in an apartment. The compost is in a small plastic container that can fit under your sink or on a balcony. Many people are worried about the smell, but there really is no bad small if it is properly taken care of. When you open the bin you will smell a bit of an earthy smell from the new compost.</p>

<p>Why compost?</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduces the amount of waste going to our landfills</li>
<li>Makes great fertilizer for your plants</li>
</ul>

<p>The compost bin is made from plastic with ventilation holes on the top and a drainage tray on the bottom.</p>

<p>The key to keeping a compost from smelling is to have a carbon layer covering everything. I used a mixture of straw and newspaper strips, but leaves also work. The carbon source needs to be wetted, but not soaked.</p>

<p>What can be composted is any uncooked vegetables. This means all the scraps from cutting the veggies for your meals.</p>

<p>The worms of course are the important part. I also add a little dirt to the compost to get some bacterial cultures started. This means no sanitized potting soil, but dirt either from an indoor plant or from anywhere outside.</p>

<p>So now we have our vegetables on the bottom covered with a little dirt and the carbon layer on top.</p>

<p>Make sure all the composting vegetables are always covered. This means more leaves or paper needs to be added as the worms slowly eat the carbon source.</p>

<p>The compost bin is closed and can easily be stored in an apartment.</p>

<p>It is important to not overfeed the worms, otherwise the compost might start smelling. The worms should only be fed once a week to keep them from feeling disturbed. In the first four weeks they should only be fed what fits into a 1 liter container. After that they can be fed double that amount.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Urban Farmer for providing a course on vermicomposting, and the City of Vancouver for subsidizing it. The Urban Farmer can be reached at their Compost Hotline to schedule a course or to provide composting information.</p>
