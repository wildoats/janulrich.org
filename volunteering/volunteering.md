For 3 days on December 2013, I cleaned plastic and trash off of the Waterways in Squamish. It's part of my company, Salesforce's volunteering effort.

<p>I started at Nexen beach, combing the coastline for anything that might float into the ocean.</p>

<p>It's crucial from letting this trash get blown into the waterways and end up floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, in the <a href="#">Great Garbage Patch</a></p>

<p>Sorting the catch for recycling.</p>

<p>Overall this was a great project. It's great to make our community cleaner, and to prevent all this trash from going in the ocean. Squamish already does a really great job, shown by the fact that only 3 bags were collected.</p>
