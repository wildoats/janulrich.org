<p>Processor:<br>
  I looked at both AMD and Intel for possible options. AMD's products 
  seem to have fallen behind Intel's in terms of performance. They still 
  work with the 65nm technology compared with Intel's 45nm. Also in their 
  latest processor, the Phenom, they had a bug in the initial X3 release 
  having to do with the TLB. I chose a processor that was very close to 
  the cutting edge, but not the newest to increase value without sacrificing 
  too much performance. Comparing the desktop processors to server processors, 
  I noticed that this is mostly a marketing scheme by Intel as the Core 
  2 Duo E8400 is the same processor as the Xeon E3110.<br>
</p>
<p>Motherboard:<br>
  With this processor we need a motherboard for the LGA 775 socket. I 
  also wanted a motherboard with the appropriate front side bus (1333Mhz) 
  and at least support the processors memory specs (DDR2 800Mhz). I also 
  wanted an integrated graphics card as this will be server and we therefore 
  don't have to buy a graphics card. I also wanted RAID support for data 
  integrity.</p>
<p><br>
  Memory:<br>
  I wanted 4GB, which is the motherboard's maximum.</p>
<p><br>
  Hard Drive:<br>
  Since we want to minimize the risk of ever losing data, I want to set 
  up RAID 1 (Mirroring), which essentially puts identical data on both 
  drives so that if you ever lose one, you have the other one as a back-up 
  copy. I am not very particular in choosing a hard drive, but chose the 
  Barricuda since I had good experiences with it in the past. I also think 
  the 32MB cache, instead of 16MB, is worth an extra $10.</p>
<p><br>
  Case:<br>
  Small case to save space. The motherboard is micro-ATX anways.</p>
<p><br>
  UPC:<br>
  It is a good idea to protect the server from power surges or brown outs. 
  It will only last a couple of minutes though once the power is off.</p>
